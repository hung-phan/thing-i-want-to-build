    "If the number of queries you have made so far ends with a 1, the judge chooses one of the four possibilities described above (complementation, reversal, complementation + reversal, or nothing), uniformly at random and independently of all other choices, and alters the stored array accordingly. (Notice that this will happen on the very first query you make.)\n",
    "The judge responds with one line containing a single character 0 or 1, the value it currently has stored at bit position P, or N if you provided a malformed line (e.g., an invalid position).\n",
    "Then, after you have made as many of the 150 queries above as you want, you must make one more exchange of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program outputs one line containing a string of B characters, each of which is 0 or 1, representing the bits currently stored in the array (which will not necessarily match the bits that were initially present!)\n",
    "The judge responds with one line containing a single letter: uppercase Y if your answer was correct, and uppercase N if it was not (or you provided a malformed line). If you receive Y, you should begin the next test case, or stop sending input if there are no more test cases.\n",
    "After the judge sends N to your input stream, it will not send any other output. If your program continues to wait for the judge after receiving N, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit Exceeded error. As usual, if the memory limit is exceeded, or your program gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate judgment.\n",

Please be advised that although the testing tool is intended to simulate the judging system, it is NOT the real judging system and might behave differently.\n",
